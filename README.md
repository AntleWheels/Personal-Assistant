🌟 Voice Assistant Project 🌟
I am excited to share my latest project: A bilingual voice assistant built using Python! This assistant recognizes both English and Tamil commands and responds in Tamil. Some of its features include:

🎵 Playing Songs: Just ask to play your favorite song, and it will find and play it for you.

⏰ Telling Time: Get the current time on demand.

📚 Information Search: Ask about people or topics, and it will fetch summaries from Wikipedia or detailed responses from ChatGPT .

😂 Telling Jokes: Need a laugh? The assistant can tell you a joke.

🛑 Stopping on Command: You can stop the assistant anytime with a simple command.
This project leverages various libraries including OpenAI for AI responses, Google Speech Recognition for command recognition, gTTS for text-to-speech conversion, and Google Translate for language translation.
